**Problem Statement**
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or nt a hotel was likely to receive adisporportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can helpyou explore those questions! This daa set contain booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the bookingwas made,length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of availabe parking spaces,among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.
